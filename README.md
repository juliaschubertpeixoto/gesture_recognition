# gesture_recognition
This repository contains the source code for a gesture recognition application.
Three neural networks are used: Convolutional Neural Networks, LSTM and GRU.
Two skeleton-based datasets are explored: MSRC-12 and NTU RGB+D.
In this repository are avaible some jupyter notebooks and python codes.
